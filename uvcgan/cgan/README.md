# Design Decisions

When designing model architecture, I have made a number of decisions that
seemed fine to me, but may cause problems in the future. I am going to
summarize them below.


## Domains

I have hardcoded existence of only two domains --  domain `a` and domain `b`.

## Images

`ModelBase` class descendants use `images` member to store various
input/output/intermediate images. Below, I will describe some naming
conventions of the images:

* `real_a`, `real_b` -- original input images from domain `a` and domain `b`
  correspondingly.

* `fake_a` -- image translated from domain `b` into domain `a`.
   E.g. style transfer: `real_b` -> `fake_a`.

* `fake_b` -- image translated domain `a` -> domain `b`.

* `reco_a` -- reconstructed image in domain `a`. For example, it could be
  an image generated by an autoencoder from `real_a` -> `reco_a`. Another
  example, is a cyclically transferred image by the cyclegan, like
  `real_a` -> `fake_b` -> `reco_a`.

* `reco_b` -- reconstructed image in domain `b`.
