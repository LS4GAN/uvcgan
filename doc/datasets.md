# CelebA Datasets

**NOTE**: As of June 2023, the download links to the reference CouncilGAN's
CelebA datasets are no longer working. To use the CelebA datasets for I2I
translation, one needs to recreate them. Please refer to
[celeba4cyclegan](https://github.com/LS4GAN/celeba4cyclegan) for instructions
on how to do that.

The `uvcgan` paper used preprocessed CelebA datasets, similar to the CouncilGAN
and ACL-GAN papers. The preprocessed datasets can be located by the following
links

```

that were extracted from the CouncilGAN `download.sh` script:

# Selfie2Anime

The Selfie2Anime dataset is the same dataset as used by the U-GAT-IT paper
and can be found by the following URL:
